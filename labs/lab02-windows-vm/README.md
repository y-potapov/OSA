Lab 2 — A Windows guest, and a network between them
Pair: Arman Ibrayev Driver first half: Arman
Machine: Asus TUF gaming A15, Windows 11, 8 GB RAM, 6 cores>, guests Ubuntu Server + Windows 11 Enterprise eval
Date: 27.10.2026
What I did
1. Downloaded Windows 11 Enterprise evaluation. Licence: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-11-enterprise
2. Created lab02-windows: 2 vCPU, 4 GB, 64 GB thin, UEFI + Secure Boot, vTPM.
3. Network mode: VirtualBox NAT Network (NatNetwork), both guests. Why: Standard VirtualBox NAT isolates each VM behind an independent router, preventing them from seeing each other. Bridged mode fails on campus Wi-Fi due to MAC filtering. NAT Network provides an internal shared subnet with outbound Internet access.
4. Ping Ubuntu → Windows timed out because Windows Defender Firewall blocks inbound ICMPv4 Echo Requests by default on Public network profiles. Fixed with: New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow ping in (ICMPv4)" -Protocol ICMPv4 -IcmpType 8 -Direction Inbound -Action Allow
5. Overcommitment: set 5 GB + 5 GB on a 8 GB host.

Result:
Metric | Before | After
Host RAM in use | 6.2 GB | I can't take a screenshot after adding more RAM because as soon as I open two virtual machines with 5 GB of memory each, my laptop immediately SHUTS DOWN, and nothing helps.
Available RAM |1.2 GB |
Commited memory | 9/17.4 |
Cached memory |1.2 GB |
What I noticed
After reallocating RAM between two virtual machines, the allocated memory became heavily overloaded; as a result, the laptop triggered a safety shutdown—demonstrating the potential consequences for the host system when RAM is reallocated incorrectly.
What did not work for the first time
1. Initially, Ubuntu could not successfully ping Windows because incoming ICMP requests were blocked by Windows Firewall
2. I couldn't take photos as proof after adding the RAM because the laptop shuts down immediately.
